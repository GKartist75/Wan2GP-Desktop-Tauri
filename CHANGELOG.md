# Changelog — Wan2GP Desktop Launcher (Tauri)

All notable changes. Dates are release dates; `Unreleased` tracks `master`.

## [Unreleased]

- Python fallback that counts: preflight finds before downloading (a manually installed exact Python is accepted — setup.py's `uv venv` reuses the same discovery, so the env gets built from it), exact-version verify everywhere, and failure messages that list what was actually found plus the three fixes
- Resolved install stack renders again (was fed the wrong backend shape, so it never appeared) — now with GPU/CUDA/Python/uv/profile, free disk, and target verdict

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-05

No more silent failures: every step of install, reuse, migrate and launch is checked, reported honestly, and recoverable.

**Install tells the truth**
- `setup.py` exit code propagated with actionable hints — a dead install can never report `Installation complete!` again; failure offers Retry + Copy diagnostics
- Success gated on a post-install smoke test (`import torch` + CUDA visible on NVIDIA), not just exit code 0
- Task list tracks what `setup.py` actually emits (`[*] Install <Component>` headers + uv package lines) — phases no longer stick on PENDING mid-install
- Exact Python pin preflight (`uv self update` → provision → run-verify → force-reinstall if corrupt, downloads forced on, uv data-drive space checked); pin read from upstream `setup_config.json` so the next bump can't re-open the hole
- Missing-tool checks (`git`/`uv`/`python`/`conda`) actually trigger now

**Reuse, migrate & clean, safely**
- Target-folder triage: empty / healthy / broken-env / repo-no-env / Pinokio / foreign, with Fresh / Install-repair / Choose-empty-folder choices instead of blind merges
- "Use existing" validates first (python exists + runs) and offers repair on failure
- Reinstall always asks first: backup dialog with folder sizes, optional plugins/settings backup (restored automatically), per-model Move-to… rows
- `move_folder` has live progress, locked-file tolerance and post-verify; model-drive disk gates (warn <50 GB, block <10 GB per drive)
- Pinokio trees detected and refused (install/repair/wipe/uninstall) — one-click "reuse its models in a fresh install" instead; reusing a Pinokio install directly is not supported
- Drive roots auto-resolve (`J:\` → `J:\Wan2GP`); picked folders stick even before they exist (fixed fallback to `C:\Wan2GP`); missing previous install (disconnected drive) warns instead of a blank first run
- Keep/Update/Skip choices only appear for healthy installs; uninstall and post-uninstall return to the installer, never an empty dashboard
- Manage → Updates has "🧭 Run Setup again"; uninstall is an explicit Keep my models / Delete everything (sizes shown, AGREE to confirm) / Cancel modal
- Migration modal: explicit Move & restart vs Just switch to it (no second popup, drive roots auto-resolve)
- Live download panel during install: per-file rows with sizes, animated bars and installed versions parsed from uv output
- Active Environment has "reinstall": full env recreate (venv, Python, torch, kernels, smoke test) — "restore" only re-pips requirements

**Launch & everyday polish**
- Launch pre-flights `import torch` and refuses with directions instead of a traceback; exit codes render as numbers; Launch buttons need repo + active env
- Default browser honored: Brave/Opera/Vivaldi detected (fixed `%LocalAppData%` expansion + Program Files candidates); fallback is logged, successful launches log the browser used
- Installer overview shows full per-profile versions (Triton/Sage/Sparge/Flash, kernel labels) like Electron
- Plugin updates highlighted (amber row + bold badge); env unlink narrates deletions (per-directory lines + live current file); unlink/restore hidden without a repo; `[LAUNCH ERROR] undefined` fixed everywhere

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-05

- DLSS5 panel always shows all 8 runtime files with package version + expected per-file SHA-256 (green ✓ when present, red — not installed when missing); backend owns the pinned manifest so labels can't go stale

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-05

- DLSS5 status now counts `host/nvngx.dll` (8 files, was 7) and README tracks workers v1.1.3 (upstream `33eb156`)
- Launcher update check runs once shortly after boot (5h poll alone left fresh releases unknown for hours)

## [0.2.1] — 2026-09-04

- Live console download bars: bootstrap shim actually wired into launch (isatty patch, HF progress env, `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN` mirror, per-launch temp file) — model/LoRA downloads stream tqdm bars

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-04

- **🧩 Plugin Manager** (Manage → Plugins tab): list/enable/install/update/uninstall Wan2GP plugins, search + sort, per-plugin update checks, catalog refresh from GitHub, ★ favourites auto-installed on fresh setup. **Status Pro** ships as a default plugin — installed and locked-on, still uninstallable
- **DLSS5 installer** (Dashboard card): runs Wan2GP's own `scripts/install_dlss5.ps1` with live per-component checklist (download → SHA-256 ✓ → installed) in the console; strict `I ACCEPT` consent modal, Force (backup + replace) option. Requires Windows 11 + RTX 30+ (Neural Rendering) / RTX 40+ (Frame Generation)
- **Deepy catch-up** (upstream b71026f): local **Qwen3.8 VL 27B** Prime engine (auto-raises 32k context + Summarize + repetition penalty), `repetition_penalty` in Zero preset, Prime/MCP copy
- **LLM engines**: Claude bridge pin 0.1.40 → **0.1.66** (upstream mandate), npm installs routed through `cmd /C` (fixes "program not found" on `.cmd` shims), serve button shows real running state (port-4096 probe), per-engine npm labels
- **Auto-Tune**: **Int8 Kernels** default-on (experimental, ~10% faster with INT8 checkpoints, needs Triton) in recommendation + adjuster + writer
- **Window**: launcher opens maximized
- **Stop**: scoped to our Wan2GP processes only (tracked child + our repo's `wgp.py`) — no longer blanket-kills every Python on the machine

## [0.1.3]

- Renamed to Wan2GP Desktop Launcher Tauri (product, binary, installer)
- Topbar cleanup (port of Electron): refresh button dropped, reload moved after Console, red stop button, title no longer overlaps metrics/buttons

## [0.1.2]

- Env unlink/restore as compact buttons with state-driven visibility; env name now resolved from backend (fixes vanishing buttons)
- Unlink deletes with live console progress instead of freezing the app
- Release script fixes (version filter, ASCII-only for PS 5.1)

## [0.1.1] — current spike build

First Tauri feature-complete build (port of the Electron launcher):

- **Shell** — Rust backend in 10 modules, system WebView2, ~3 MB installer, no console flashes (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on every probe)
- **Dashboard** — batched IPC, single-wave panel paint, live sparklines, kernel wheels, env management (unlink/restore), per-package ↑ upgrades with dist-name mapping
- **Launch** — Desktop embed (console-first boot, hide/show keeps session), Browser (waits for ready, honors chosen browser + no-GPU Chrome), External Terminal (visible `.bat` console), Extra Launch Args applied and echoed
- **Auto-Tune** — full 7-profile matrix incl. P3.5/P4.5, fast-LM audio rule, no-CUDA fallback, saved-vs-rec tags, validated writer
- **Deepy** — mode/engine/enhancer pairs enforced in backend, Zero + Prime presets match upstream, live round-trip test
- **Updates** — one-click Tauri updater (signed) + `scripts/release-tauri.ps1`; Wan2GP core update via git pull
- **Notifier** — Apprise engine (Telegram/Discord/…), log-driven complete/fail/progress events, test + auto-install
- **Settings repair** — dropdown clamps + nested-path fix with `.bak-repair` backups, matching the UI shape
- **Migration** — legacy Electron detection + silent removal (data kept), self-uninstall with keep-models prompt, full cleanup on launcher close (server, helper PIDs, Explorer windows)
- **Docs** — README rewritten for Tauri, live screenshot
